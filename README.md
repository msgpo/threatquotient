## Configuring Attributes

The ThreatQ integration supports providing a list of Indicator Attributes you would like displayed in the Overlay Window.
These attributes are configured in the `config/config.js` file under the `threatQAttributes` property.

The `threatQAttributes` property is an array of attribute objects where each attribute object has the following required
and optional properties:

* `name` (Required) - A string name for the attribute which should match the name of the attribute in ThreatQ (case sensitive)
* `editable` (Required) - A boolean indicating whether the attribute can be edited by users (including deletion)
* `values` (Optional) - An array of possible string values for the attribute

```
{
    threatQAttributes: [{
        name: 'Investigation',
        editable: false
    },
    {
      name: 'Confidence',
      editable: ['low', 'medium', 'high']
    },
    {
      name: 'False Positive',
      editable: true,
      values: ['true', 'false']
   }]
}
```
