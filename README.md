## Configuring Indicator Types

The ThreatQ integration requires that you provide a mapping of indicator types to their respective indicator IDs in your
ThreatQ instance.  This information can be configured in the `config/threatq.config.js` file under the `threatQIndicatorTypes`
property.  This property is an object which has a supported indicator type as the key, and the numeric ID value for that type.
As each ThreatQ instance has different indicator IDs you will need to modify this value with your own indicator IDs.

The supported indicator types are:

* ipv4
* email
* domain
* md5
* sha1
* sha256
* url

You can specify the indicator ID for each type like this:

```
  threatQIndicatorTypes: {
    ipv4: 11,
    email: 3,
    domain: 8,
    md5: 12,
    sha1: 16,
    sha256: 17,
    url: 21
  }
```

The simplest way to get the indicator type values is to login into your ThreatQ instance via your browser, and then navigate
to the following URL:

```
https://<your-threatq-server>/api/indicator/types
```

> Note that if this endpoint returns an empty result `{}` your account does not have access to view the indicator types. 
Please contact your ThreatQ administrator for these values if you are unable to access the above endpoint.

## Configuring Attributes

The ThreatQ integration supports providing a list of Indicator Attributes you would like displayed in the Overlay Window.
These attributes are configured in the `config/threatq.config.js` file under the `threatQAttributes` property.

The `threatQAttributes` property is an array of attribute objects where each attribute object has the following required
and optional properties:

* `name` (Required) - A string name for the attribute which should match the name of the attribute in ThreatQ (case sensitive)
* `editable` (Required) - A boolean indicating whether the attribute can be edited by users (including deletion)
* `values` (Optional) - An array of possible string values for the attribute

```
{
    threatQAttributes: [{
        name: 'Investigation',
        editable: false
    },
    {
      name: 'Confidence',
      editable: ['low', 'medium', 'high']
    },
    {
      name: 'False Positive',
      editable: true,
      values: ['true', 'false']
   }]
}
```
